Autoreply weechat Plugin
---

Autoreply is a weechat script to automatically react on a private buffer whenever a message is received.
The goal is to keep weechat in foreground and set an automatic reply without closing the client.
Auto-replies are sent according to the *time* config option, and it avoids to reply with the same message
if a bunch of messages are received.
